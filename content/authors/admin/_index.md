Welcome to my humble webpage. _My Brain is Open ~ Paul Erdos_. 

I am Faithful Chiagoziem ONWUEGBUCHE, a third-year PhD Candidate in Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology at the [SFI Center for Research Training in Machine Learning (ML-Labs)](https://www.ml-labs.ie/cohort_3/faithful-onwuegbuche/), University College Dublin [(UCD)](https://ucdcs-research.ucd.ie/phd-student/faithful-chiagoziem-onwuegbuche/), Ireland. Additionally, I am affiliated with the SFI Research Centre for Software [(LERO)](https://lero.ie/) and the Security, Privacy, Adaptation & Requirements Engineering [(SPARE)](https://spare.lero.ie/people/) group. My supervisors are Associate Prof. [Liliana Pasquale](https://people.ucd.ie/liliana.pasquale) and Dr [Anca Delia Jurcut](https://people.ucd.ie/anca.jurcut). 

My research interest is in the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, focusing on their applications in finance and cybersecurity. My goal is to build AI systems capable of securing our critical infrastructure, detecting financial fraud and increasing financial inclusion mostly in developing countries. My PhD research is on Machine Learning based Techniques for Adaptive Intrusion Detection of Ransomware Attacks. 

Professionally, I have over seven years of relevant work experience gained as a data scientist, machine learning researcher and lecturer. Recently, I interned at [Mastercard Ireland](https://www.mastercard.ie/en-ie.html) Foundry Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence R&D Team. During this period, I developed an AI model to detect fraudulent transactions within the Bitcoin cryptocurrency network, which is currently pending patent approval. Also, I was awarded the [SFI-NSF research grant](https://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/us-ireland-supplemental/), and was a visiting research scholar at the [AWARE-AI Lab, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/nrtai/research). We co-authored a paper on using Large Language models to identify psychological vulnerabilities exploited in phishing emails.

Previously, I obtained two master's degrees: Financial Technology (FinTech) with Distinction from the University of Stirling, UK, and Financial Mathematics from the Pan African University, Kenya, as a [Commonwealth Shared Scholar](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-shared-scholarships/) and [African Union Scholar](https://pau-au.africa/about/background), respectively. My undergraduate degree was in BSc Mathematics and Statistics from Ignatius Ajuru University of Education, where I graduated with First Class Honours and was the Overall Best Graduating Student.

In addition to academic and professional achievements, I naturally use my position and resources to positively impact lives. I conduct mentorship sessions for younger scientists, deliver talks at workshops, and lead community development initiatives. In my spare time and besides coding, I enjoy singing, playing the guitar (still learning), writing poetry, jogging/exercising, and exploring the wonders of nature.
