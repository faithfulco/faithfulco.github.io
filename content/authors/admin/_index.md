Welcome to my humble webpage.

My name is Faithful Chiagoziem ONWUEGBUCHE, I am a _PhD Candidate in Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology_ at the [SFI Center for Research Training in Machine Learning (ML-LABS)](https://www.ml-labs.ie/), University College Dublin. My research interest lies at the intersection and interplay of Machine Learning, Blockchain Technology, Financial Technology (FinTech), Data Science, and Mathematics.

In 2019, I obtained the prestigious [Commonwealth Shared Scholarship](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-shared-scholarships/) by the UK Government and completed an _MSc in Financial Technology (FinTech)_ with Distinction at the [University of Stirling, UK](https://www.stir.ac.uk/courses/pg-taught/fintech/) supervised by [Dr Deepayan Bhowmik](http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~dbh/). My research was on "System Properties Based Malware Detection using Machine Learning". Prior to this position, I was an [African Union Commission Scholar](https://au.int/en/overview) at the [Pan African University, Institute for Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation (PAUSTI)](https://pau-au.africa/), where I graduated with an _MSc in Financial Mathematics_, under the supervision of [Dr Joseph Kyalo Mung’atu](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/departments/statistics/joseph-kyalo-mungatu-3/) and [Prof. Muliaro Joseph Wafula](https://codata.org/blog/2018/10/01/muliaro-wafula-candidacy-for-codata-executive-committee-2/). I conducted a research that measured value-at-risk in Nigerian Banks using an innovative approach of incorporating tweet sentiments. I previously graduated with a First Class Honours in _B.Sc.Ed. Mathematics and Statistics_, and was awarded the valedictorian.

Professionally, I have over five years of relevant work experience gained as a data scientist, research scholar, teacher, leader in several projects and community developer. Through these positions, I have built profound skills in data analysis, Machine Learning, research, leadership, verbal and written communication, time management, team building capability, problem-solving capacity as well as exceptional innovative abilities. 
  
Besides academic, professional and research excellence, it is in my nature to utilise my position and available resources to impact people’s lives positively. In 2016, I was awarded the _Best Performing NYSC President_ due to my impactful and selfless community service. Recently, I served as the _West Scotland Regional Network Coordinator_, under the auspices of the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK, where I helped scholars make the best of their stay in the UK and equipped them as transformative change agents for their respective Commonwealth countries and the world in general. 

At my spare time, I love singing, playing guitar (which I am still learning), peotry, jogging/exercising and just exploring all the wonder mother nature has to offer.
